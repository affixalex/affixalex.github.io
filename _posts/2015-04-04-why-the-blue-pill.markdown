I'll try to avoid waxing philosophical but I wanted to explain the reasoning 
behind the title of this blog. Do I even know what the difference is between 
the blue and red pills? The answer is yes. I want the blue one, thanks.

To me, choosing the blue pill in the world of software means accepting the 
abstractions that we are currently presented with. I am not interested in 
fighting any unnecessary battles with our machine overlords; from where I'm 
sitting, they seem benevolent. For example, we have a kernel with a clearly 
delineated boundary between userspace... and that's just how things are. I 
would agree that AArch64 is a much better instruction set than x86_64, but I 
don't care because these Xeons are fast as shit. Representational state 
transfer is just the best way to develop an HTTP API but you're free to go lead 
an anachronistic underground SOAP rebellion if you'd like!

The prevailing wisdom has prevailed in most cases because... well... it's wise. 
I can totally understand the impulse to engage in autoerotic operating system 
development (we've all been there) and I certainly think that research projects 
have their place, but I am not in that place. To the extent which we can choose 
abstractions that resound with us and still get things done, we should probably 
do so. Happy people build better stuff. If Haskell helps you sleep at night, 
then by all means... write it! That actually probably does make you better than 
me, I won't even argue it.

Let me throw out an axiom here:

`algorithms + data structures = programs`

Let's test some inline math $x$, $y$, $x_1$, $y_1$.

A programming language is just a notation that we use to describe algorithms 
and data structures and in most cases we're just doing it for money (another 
abstraction which I won't go into). It's not a reflection on me as a human 
being, it's only software. Taking the blue pill means just not caring 
about things that ultimately don't matter and will probably be unpleasant to 
confront. One UNIX is mostly as good as the next, if you can't quantify a 
decision then it's just a matter of preference. Who cares? I could whine about 
the Federal Reserve or I could go buy something to eat. I'll tune into a 
metaphysical frequency for a moment and concede that the physical world we 
experience may not actually be the highest order of reality, but I really 
don't care. The sun feels good on my face, that's all I need to know right now.

I like Python. Don't judge me. I know zsh kinda sucks, but I use it anyway. I 
get that OSX is bloated and silly and kinda cliche but I just want this thing 
to work, okay? I want the blue pill! Gimme a hug!

To me, taking the blue pill as a programmer is choosing the abstractions that 
allow me to create value in the world as we currently know it to be. It is 
deciding not to go against the grain in favor of being happy and profitable. To 
say that the Federal Reserve is neither federal nor a reserve is true in the 
strictest sense, but it is completely missing the forest for the trees. You 
could make similar arguments about the false economy of Ruby or Python or 
Javascript and they would also be missing the point.

The point, in my mind, is to solve problems rather than inventing new ones.

Just take the blue pill, man. Just take it and relax. The robots won the war, get over it.
