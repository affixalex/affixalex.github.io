The idea here is to share some of my thoughts on technology and, in general, 
just put myself out there. I'll try to share some interesting technical content 
and write about [my studies in machine learning](https://github.com/hypoalex/machine_learning/blob/master/README.ipynb)... but I might also occasionally 
throw in some random things that I find funny. 

I make no guarantees about update frequency or post quality, but I'll try to 
stay on top of this thing as a mechanism to see how my thoughts and opinions 
evolve over time. Hopefully, others will find it interesting
